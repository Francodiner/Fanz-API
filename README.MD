# FANZ Backend Challenge

### Description

The project has different endpoints to obtain event information on the blockchain and addresses data.

### Technologies and Structures

# Backend

-NodeJS, Express, Web3, GraphQL and Axios were used for the creation of the backend.

-Supertest and Jest were used for testing.

-We have services for the calls to the APIÂ´s and queries linked to them, which are executed in the controller together with the business logic.

## Available routes:

# EVENTS
